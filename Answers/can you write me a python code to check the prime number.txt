OpenAI Response for: helper can you write me a python code to check the prime number

Sure, here is a simple python code to check if a number is prime or not:

```
# function to check if the number is prime or not
def is_prime(n):
    # a prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself
    # so we check if the number is divisible by any other number
    # starting from 2
    for i in range(2,n):
        # if the number is divisible by any other number
        # then it is not a prime number
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    # if the number is not divisible by any other number
    # then it is a prime number
    return True

# take input from the user
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# call the is_prime function and store the result in a variable
result = is_prime(number)

# check the result and print the appropriate message
if result == True:
    print(number, "is a prime number")
else:
    print(number, "is not a prime number")
```

Example Output:

```
Enter a number: 17
17 is a prime number

Enter a number: 25
25 is not a prime number
```
